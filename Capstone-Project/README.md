### Data
The dataset for this project consisted of a subset of data from the [Cresci-2017 dataset](https://botometer.osome.iu.edu/bot-repository/datasets.html), a collection of  genuine users (human) , fake followers, social spambots and traditional spam bots in .csv format. The subsets described below were used in training, validating and testing our model.

- **fake_followers.csv:** A collection of fake accounts bought from three different providers in April 2013 - fastfollowerz.com, intertwitter.com, and twittertechnology.com 
- **genuine_accounts.csv:** Random sample of human accounts generated by contacting users with a simple question in natural language, verified by a human.
